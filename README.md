YouFolio
========

YouFolio code base for now!

I have made a pivotal tracker account and created a few tasks. I will add more soon, and hopefully attach mockups and meaningful specs!

As of now we are using sails.js as the primary backend and angular.js as the client side javascript framework.

To run this locally for development purposes (there are more steps for production that we will document in the future) first make sure you have node and npm installed and on your path then you can run the following.

```bash
cd <Youfolio directory>
npm install -g sails
npm install
sails lift
```
